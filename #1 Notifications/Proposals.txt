# Some proposals for writing the book:

1.  Use first-person most, you can also use the second person but not too much.
. For example, "Ei aodhai-e  amra shiklam" instead of  "Ei aodhai-e tomra shikle" 

2. Use nice pictures

3. Speak frankly. Don't  be too formal. Try to start a section with a small story of your life or any relevant  story of mathematician life. For example, "A famous mathematician was come to this idea while he was....."

4. 4. Use a tab before starting each paragraph.
